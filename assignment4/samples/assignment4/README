Building the assignment

	Follow the build instructions 1-3 found in section "Building a Sample Application" in http://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.10.0/getting_started/getting_started.html

	Now move all the Kconfig, CMakeList.txt, and project to their respective locations
	Example:
		cp PROJECT_DIR/drivers/Kconfig ZEPHYR_DIR/drivers/Kconfig
		...
		cp PROJECT_DIR/samples/cse522-team18-assgn04 ZEPHYR_DIR/samples/cse522-team18-assgn04

	Next, move to "ZEPHYR_DIR/samples/cse522-team18-assgn04/build/galileo"
	$ cmake -DBOARD=galileo ../..
	$ make

	Now setup the SD card as per http://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.10.0/boards/x86/galileo/doc/galileo.html and boot.

Board Wiring

	The board is connected to 2 HCSR04 devices and 1 EEPROM.

	The first HCSR04 has Trig connected to shield pin 2 and Echo to shield pin 0
	The second HCSR04 has Trig connected to shield pin 3 and Echo to shield pin 1

	The EEPROM has SCL connected to shield pin 19 and SCA to shield pin 18.
	Additionally A0, A1, A2, and WP are connected to ground.

Running

	The program uses the Zephyr Shell that accepts 3 functions

	Enable n (n=0, 1,or 2, to enable none, HCSR0, or HCSR1)

	Start p (to erase all  pages  of  the EEPROM  and  to start  collecting  and  recording  distance measures from page 0. The operation stops until p pages of EEPROM are filled, where p <= 512.)

	Dump p1 p2 (p1 <= p2, to dump (print out) the distance measures recorded in pages p1 to p2 on console)
