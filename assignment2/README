Schedulability Analysis: Assignment 2

To compile the program run
	'make'

To remove the program run
	'make clean'

The run the program
	'./schedule_feasibility input.txt'

	where input.txt is an input file, following the parameters given in the assignment

	The program will output the results to the "out/" directory, where algorithm specific files can be found. The files use the format.

		is_schedulable utilization
		is_schedulable utilization
		is_schedulable utilization
		...

	where is_schedulable is an integer 0 or 1 and utilization is a decimal value.

	The result files are overwritten after every run of the program.

See Schedulability Analysis Algorithm compassion graphs, using data matching parameters set in the assignment.
